# Spring_Security_Template
Spring 3.0, Security 6.0

Current Problems: 
+       Authorities are being saved as a List of Strings. We could also convert it into a SET
+       DONE - No Exception Handling for Username (or in general)
+       Intellij Ultimate - best practices aren't being followed thoroughly 
+       General Error handling Example: (Login causes an error if the user DOES NOT exist)

Do not forget to change Application.properties to match your Database Setup!

+	 Custom Login/Logout

+	 Thymeleaf Frontend (all in one project)
